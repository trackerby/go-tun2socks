## Features

- Support both TCP and UDP
- Support both IPv4 and IPv6 (but unfortunately, IPv6 still not usable on Windows because lacks of TUN support)
- Support ICMP local echoing with configurable packet delay time
- Support proxy handlers: `SOCKS5`, `Shadowsocks`, `V2Ray` (DNS cache is enabled in these handlers by default)
- Dynamically adding routing rules according to V2Ray's routing results (V2Ray proxy handler only)
- Intercepting DNS requests and dispatching them with V2Ray's flexible DNS client (V2Ray proxy handler only)

## Build

`go-tun2socks` is using `cgo`, thus a C compiler is required.

```sh
go get github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks
go get -d ./...
make clean && make build
./build/tun2socks -h
```

An alternative way to build (or cross compile) tun2socks is to use [`xgo`](https://github.com/karalabe/xgo), to use `xgo`, you also need `docker`:

```sh
# install docker: https://docs.docker.com/install

# install xgo
go get github.com/karalabe/xgo

go get github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/eycorsican/go-tun2socks
go get -d ./...
make clean && make release
ls ./build
```

## Run

```sh
./build/tun2socks -tunName tun1 -tunAddr 240.0.0.2 -tunGw 240.0.0.1 -proxyType socks -proxyServer 1.2.3.4:1086
```

Note that the TUN device may have a different name, and it should be a different name on Windows unless you have renamed it, so make sure use `ifconfig`, `ipconfig` or `ip addr` to check it out.

## Create TUN device and Configure Routing Table

Suppose your original gateway is 192.168.0.1. The proxy server address is 1.2.3.4.

The following commands will need root permissions.

### macOS

The program will automatically create a TUN device for you on macOS. To show the created TUN device, use ifconfig.

Delete original gateway:

```sh
route delete default
```

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
route add default 240.0.0.1
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
route add 1.2.3.4/32 192.168.0.1
```

### Linux

The program will not create the TUN device for you on Linux. You need to create the TUN device by yourself:

```sh
ip tuntap add mode tun dev tun1
ip addr add 240.0.0.1 dev tun1
ip link set dev tun1 up
```

Delete original gateway:

```sh
ip route del default
```

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
ip route add default via 240.0.0.1
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
ip route add 1.2.3.4/32 via 192.168.0.1
```

### Windows

To create a TUN device on Windows, you need [Tap-windows](http://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/), refer [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/badvpn/wikis/tun2socks.wiki) for more information.

Add our TUN interface as the default gateway:

```sh
# Using 240.0.0.1 is not allowed on Windows, we use 10.0.0.1 instead
route add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 metric 6
```

Add a route for your proxy server to bypass the TUN interface:

```sh
route add 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.1 metric 5
```

## A few notes for using V2Ray proxy handler
- Using V2Ray proxy handler: `tun2socks -proxyType v2ray -vconfig config.json`
- V2Ray proxy handler dials connections with a [V2Ray Instance](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/blob/master/functions.go)
- Configuration file V2Ray must in JSON format
- Proxy server addresses in the configuration file should be IPs and not domains except your system DNS will match "direct" rules
- Configuration file should not contain direct `domain` rules, since they cause infinitely looping requests
- Dynamic routing happens prior to packets input to lwIP, the [V2Ray Router](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/blob/master/features/routing/router.go) is used to check if the IP packet matching "direct" tag, information available for the matching process are (protocol, destination ip, destination port)
- To enable dynamic routing, just set the `-gateway` argument, for example: `tun2socks -proxyType v2ray -vconfig config.json -gateway 192.168.0.1`
- The tag "direct" is hard coded to identify direct rules, which if dynamic routing is enabled, will indicate adding routes to the original gateway for the corresponding IP packets
- Inbounds are not necessary
- DNS requests will be intercepted and instead dispatching by V2Ray's DNS client, for this sake, you can have, for example, the following config to keep away from DNS poisoning and having inappropriate CDN IPs:
```
    "dns": {
        "clientIP": "x.x.x.x",
        "hosts": {
            "localhost": "127.0.0.1",
            "domain:lan": "127.0.0.1",
            "domain:local": "127.0.0.1",
            "domain:arpa": "127.0.0.1"
        },
        "servers": [
            "8.8.8.8",
            {
                "address": "223.5.5.5",
                "port": 53,
                "domains": [
                    "geosite:cn"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```

## TODO
- Built-in routing rules and routing table management
- Support ICMP packets forwarding

## Development

The core part of this project is the `core` package, it focus on `tun2socks`'s `2` part, the core package has fully IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP support, and only depend on lwIP (include a few platform-dependent code) and Go's standard library. On the one hand, IP packets input to or output from the `lwIP Stack` that initialized by `core.NewLWIPStack()`, on the other hand, TCP/UDP connections would "socksified" by the core package and can be handled by your own `core.ConnectionHandler` implementation.

As for the `tun` part, different OS may has it's own interfaces.

For example:
- macOS
  - macOS has TUN/TAP support by its BSD kernel
  - Apple also provides an easy way to filter inbound or outbound IP packets by [`IP Filters`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/NKEConceptual/ip_filter_nke/ip_filter_nke.html) (Proxifier seems use this method)
- Linux
  - Linux has TUN/TAP support by the kernel
- Windows
  - Windows has no kernel support for TUN/TAP, but OpenVPN has [implemented one](https://github.com/OpenVPN/tap-windows6)
- iOS
  - Apple provides [`NEPacketTunnelProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider), and one may read/write IP packets from/to the [`packetFlow`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider/1406185-packetflow)
- Android
  - I am not familiar with Android, but it uses Linux as kernel so should also has TUN/TAP drivers support
  - Android also provides an easy way to read/write IP packets with [VpnService.Builder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService.Builder#establish())

## This project is using lwIP 

This project is using a modified version of lwIP, you can checkout this repo to find out what are the changes: https://github.com/eycorsican/lwip
